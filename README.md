## The producer-consumer problem

In computing, the producer-consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue. 

I was assigned the final project in advanced Java to comprehend multithreading by tackling the producer-consumer problem. I solved the task utilizing ThreadPool and LinkedBlockingDeque. Additionally, I ensured that the program can resume from its previous state upon shutdown by implementing file reading to recreate objects.
